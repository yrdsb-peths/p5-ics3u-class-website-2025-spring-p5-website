# Class Website - Let's build this together!

## A. Make a branch
1. Clone the repository using Github Desktop.

1. **Choose option 1 - Contribute to parent repo**

1. Create a branch, perhaps name it your `<first name>`.

## B. Keeping your branch up to date

1. Switch to the `main` branch and **pull** the latest changes.

1. Now, switch back to `<first name>` and merge the latest changes from `main`:

1. If there are merge conflicts, open the conflicting files in VSCode, resolve the differences, then commit the resolved files.

## C. Make changes

1. Open `index.html`. You can use VSCode or another editor.

1. Find the place on the page where student wepbage links should go.

1. Add a link to your personal GitHub page. Example:
   ```html
   <li><a href="https://your-github-username.github.io" target="_blank">First Name</a></li>
   ```

1. Save and commit the changes.

1. Pull and merge any updates from main. Resolve any conflicts before continuing.

## D. Open a Pull Request

1. In Github Desktop or on the Github Dashboard, create a new **Pull Request** from your branch to the `main`.

1. Make changes to your branch if you need to fix up things.

1. Wait for approval and merge! The changes you made in `<first name>` are now part of `main`!

## E. Keep Contributing!
Once your PR is merged:
- Suggest and implement cool features.
- Work with classmates to improve the design!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰ðŸš€
